# Predict Sarcasm using Python and Machine Learning
This Python script uses Machine Learning to determine whether a given text input is either sarcastic or not sarcastic. It was trained using a dataset of 1.3 million Reddit comments.

Dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/sarcasm)

I also followed a tutorial to make this code, [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/08/24/sarcasm-detection-with-machine-learning/) is the tutorial. Note that the tutorial uses a *different* dataset than the one here, with a different purpose- the tutorial linked is for a project to detect sarcasm in *news headlines* as opposed to a social media comment.
